# Subsentry
# What the product does
An app that tracks all your monthly and yearly subscriptions (like Netflix, Spotify, or work tools) in one place.
# Why It Matters
People forget what they pay for. This leads to wasted money, unexpected charges when renewals hit, and general financial stress because they don't know where their money is going every month. The goal is to give people total clarity and control over their recurring payments so they never pay for something they don't use.
